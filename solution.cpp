  - S = {-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4}
  - sort S to make eliminating duplicates easier
    S = {-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2}
  - just like creating combinations, we start from the
    first element, and for duplicate numbers,
    we only pick one of them so we can avoid creating duplicate triplets
  - to optimize the time complexity, we can loop through the
    array to find the first and second elements of the triplet.
    To find the third element, we do a lookup by the value (0-num[i]-num[j])
    to see if there is any occurrence of that value in a map to save time

    - {-4,-1, t} t = 0 - (-4) - (-1) = 5 -> no answer
    - skip the next -1 as it would create a duplicate triplet if there is an aswer
    - {-4,0,t} (x)
       ...
    - {-1, -1, t} t = 0 - (-1) -(-1) = 2 -> {-1,-1, 2}
      - notice that second -1 is at different level than the first -1,
        just like in the the combination questions it's not considered
        as a duplicate number.
    - also critical is to make sure there is enogh count for each number
      that constitutes the triplet. Consider the extreme case where the triplet
      is {0, 0, 0} so map[0] = 3. This means we need to check if map[0] >= 3 to
       make sure we have enough number of zero's to form a triplet.
